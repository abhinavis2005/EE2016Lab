# Experiment 2
To write and simulate AVR assembly code in Microchip Studio

Problem 1 (Common 8-bit mathematical operation): Given two 8-
bit binary words (byte), compute the sum and store it in a register.
Problem 2 (16-bit addition using a 8-bit processor): Given two 16-
bit binary words (byte), compute the sum and store it in a register.
Problem 3 (Multiplication of two 8-bit numbers): Given two 8-
bit binary words (byte), compute the product and store it in a register.
Problem 4 (Largest of number given): Given a nite set of binary words, identify the largest in the given set.
